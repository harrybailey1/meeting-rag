Outcome 1: Employment

2.6

2.7

The Secretary of DEWR, Ms Natalie James, made a statement regarding the
Pacific Australian Labour Mobility scheme (PALM scheme) before the
committee moved to questions:

You might recall from previous discussions about the PALM scheme, as we
refer to it, that its domestic operations were insourced from a private
provider at the end of 2023. This enabled us to strengthen oversight of the
domestic operations and implement a new delivery model. Shortly after the
insourcing process was finalised—it was a complex process—we became
concemed about the PALM worker numbers and how they were being
calculated. In response to this, we commenced a data-quality review of the
PALM scheme worker data. We carried this out with the assistance of the
department's chief data officer. This review identified a number of factors
that were contributing to incorrect calculation of worker data.

We know how important PALM is to our stakeholders and how important
it is to be transparent and have reliable data. We have established a new
methodology to calculate worker numbers. We've commenced a process of
recalculation. This is specialised work. We want to make sure that we have
confidence in data going forward.”

The committee also discussed the following matters:
* Closing the Gap targets 7 and 8:

— update on progress in meeting the targets;*

* Research project involving Dr. Randa Abdel-Fattah.28

Australian National University
2.25 Professor Genevieve Bell, appeared before the committee for the first time in her
role as the President and Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University
(ANU). This was also just the second time that the ANU had appeared at an
estimates hearing, with its first appearance being in 2014. Professor Bell made a
short opening statement reflecting on some of the challenges the university
sector is currently facing:

Students of all ages come from all over Australia and from more than a
hundred countries around the world to study with us. Our student
population is small by Australian university standards, and that allows us
to offer a unique learning experience, featuring a low ratio of students to
academic staff and the highest proportion of students living on campus
accommodation in the sector. Currently, the higher education sector is
facing some challenges that I am sure we will discuss today, including a
rapidly evolving policy landscape, the impact of slowing migration
numbers on universities as well as the encampment protests that have
sparked much public debate. Our commitment to the classic ideal of the
university — academic rigour, free inquiry, and free expression and the right
to protest—is not without its challenges. Our campus is one of several in
Australia and many more across the world that have seen protest activity in
recent times, reflecting on the conflict in the Middle East. Throughout this
period, the ANU has acknowledged the rights enshrined in the university's
policies on academic freedom and freedom of speech.

2.26 The committee then discussed the following matters:

Management of pro-Palestine encampments on campus:

disciplinary action;

moving of the encampment;?!!
communications to students;?!2
concerns from Jewish students;?!*
